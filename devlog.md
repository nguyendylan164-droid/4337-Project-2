For this project, I will write a Prolog program that can solve a maze. First thoughts, it is a challenging project to understand since Prolog is confusing and new to me.
I will begin the project by reviewing the provided files and determining the best place to start.

From what I understand, "example.pl" provides us with small fixed mazes and "test.pl" generates random mazes for testing. I created my "project2.pl", which will be the maze solver. For my next session, I will begin implementing helper predicates.
